<p>In September, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/management/anil-arora.html">Anil Arora</a> was appointed as the agency's 12th chief statistician.</p>

<p>The new position is actually a homecoming for Mr. Arora, who began his StatCan career in 1988, managing data processing in a regional office in his hometown of Edmonton. Over the next 20 years, he moved to headquarters in Ottawa and progressed through a wide range of jobs, eventually redesigning and subsequently managing a successful 2006 Census. In 2008, he became Assistant Chief</p></div>]]></content>

<p>Statistics Canada conducted this survey annually from 1937 to 2011 to present a national picture of the socioeconomic characteristics of full-time academic staff working in universities. To meet targets announced in Budget 2012, Statistics Canada refocused some of its resources, and, as a result, cancelled the <abbr title="University and College Academic Staff System">UCASS</abbr>.

<p>Every year, StatCan receives almost 50,000 requests for information, ranging from demographic (<em>How many people live in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan?</em>) to historical (<em>How many pubs were in Montréal in 1886?</em>) to business (<em>Can you provide me with an in-depth profile of Sydney, Nova Scotia?</em>). They also ask specific questions about surveys (<em>What parts of this questionnaire do I fill out?</em>), and, sometimes, just want to share a piece of their mind.</p>

It takes over 35,000 employees and millions of dollars to count every single person living in Canada. The man who is ultimately responsible for this endeavour—along with all other operations at Statistics Canada—is Canada's Chief Statistician, Wayne R. Smith.</p>

<p>It has been <a href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/about-apropos/history-histoire-eng.cfm">350 years</a> since the first census data were collected in New France in the winter of 1665–1666</p></div>]]></content>
